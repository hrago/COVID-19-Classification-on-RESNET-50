# COVID-19-Classification-on-RESNET-50

This projects tachkles COVID-19 CT scan classification problem using transfer learning RESNET-50 model.

The dataset used is called "SARS-CoV-2 CT-scan dataset", which consists of 2482 CT scans of COVID-19 and Non-COVID-19 chest CT scans. I used 1200 images, 600 COVID-19 images and 600 Non-COVID-19 images due to the lack of ram on google colab. This RESNET-50 model resulted in %85 accuracy on the test images.
